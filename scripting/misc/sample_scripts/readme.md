I wrote a [blog post](http://pdgonzalez872.com/blog/t7-JavaScript.html) about the differences between Ruby and JavaScript.

One of the main differences was how valuable the standard library in Ruby is. I implement a shuffle function in JavaScript from scratch and contrast it with Ruby's elegant method call and also the C source code.

The 2 files in this folder are the source of the code for the blog post.

Please contact me with any tips/techniques you think I would benefit from.
