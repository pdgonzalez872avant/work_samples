This is a job posted on Elance that involved parsing data.

This was solved by using Python (elance_pandas.py).

The input files were:
  - pandas_1.txt
  - pandas_2.txt

The output files are:
  - output_file1.txt
  - output_file2.txt

The first file was reasonably straight forward, but the second file required some wrangling.

Traversing data is an extremely useful skill that I want to continue practicing.

Please contact me with any tips/techniques you think I would benefit from.
