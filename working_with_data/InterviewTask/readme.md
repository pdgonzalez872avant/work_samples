I researched Data Analyst positions prior to getting serious about programming. Given my background in the financial industry, I was contacted by a recruiter about a position that sounded interesting.

I am not sharing the position details nor the company's information, just the task that was asked of me and the solution I provided. It has been a while since I wrote this. My skill level has increased a lot since then. There are multiple ways of making this better, but this is what I turned in at the time.

Below are the instructions for the task. You can find my solution in the Data_Analyst_Position.py and the relevant files under the files folder.

Please contact me with any tips/techniques you think I would benefit from.

================================================================================
Paulo,

Thank you for your interest in the Data Analyst position. Based on your background and experience, we would like to proceed with the next step in our hiring process. We have a project that you will need to successfully complete in order to proceed in the interview process for the Data Analyst role.


Project: The goal of this project is to test your scripting skills. We prefer that you use VBA, but you may code this in Python 2.7, C++, C#, or Java instead. Choose only one language. If you submit multiple solutions, only one will be graded. Please find attached to this email a small csv file which has our market shares over the last 200 days.

Please write code to accomplish the following:

1. Publish the data as Date and MarketShare-squared into a separate marketshares.csv file.
2. Print the average of all the MarketShare values into a separate average.csv file.
3. Print all the dates when the MarketShare was 68.89 into a separate dates.csv file.

However, please observe the following rules:

1. Focus on extensibility and reusability of your code. Hence, avoid hard-coded values, manual input, unnecessary data operations, and functions that scale poorly where possible.
2. You should not manually edit or copy/paste any data into your code, Excel, or anywhere else.
3. If you decide to code in VBA, you may not use any Excel-related objects or functions. Do not make any reference to Cells, Ranges, Worksheets, worksheet functions, etc. Do not copy/paste data into worksheets, do not open, select, and transfer data into sheets, do not record macros, and do not use Selection.Copy.
4. If you decide to code in Python, you may not use the csv package.
5. You may not use external mathematics/data packages such as pandas, numpy, boost, etc. We expect that you should be able to accomplish the tasks in this assignment using only the functions provided by the standard libraries of your chosen language.
6. We will not answer any queries related to this project. In case of any doubts or issues, you may make any assumptions you wish as long as they are clearly stated.


Please complete this within one week.  When you have completed the tasks above, please email your source file and the three output files to Recruitment. State any assumptions that you made in the body of the email. Please include your name in the filename.  Thank you!


Regards,
