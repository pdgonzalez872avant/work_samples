This is a repo where I write sample scripts to problem solve, create something or test an idea.

Code in this folder is focused on Ruby in some way.

Please contact me with any tips/techniques you think I would benefit from.

I'm really open to learning and would love your help.

Visit [pdgonzalez872.com](www.pdgonzalez872.com) for more information.

Thanks!

Paulo
