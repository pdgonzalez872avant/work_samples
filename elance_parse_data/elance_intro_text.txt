Hi!

I am new to Elance and relatively new to the Data Analysis world. I've worked in the Financial Industry here in the US for a couple of years. Excel was my go-to and I eventually stumbled upon VBA. By using VBA, I was able to decrease my 40 hour week job to 20. Programming is just that powerful. Once I saw how much value I could add, I decided to learn more about it. Since then, I've been programming full time and now want to learn more about Data Analysis, from a programmer's perspective.

I have a mentor that helps me with my Data Analysis projects. Your project sounds like a great learning experience and an opportunity to deliver solid for an existing problem.

Hopefully we can work something out!

Thanks!

Paulo
