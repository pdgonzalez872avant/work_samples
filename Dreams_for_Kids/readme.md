This is a folder where I keep the work we do with the Dreams for Kids Associate Board.

There were some scripts that helped us save some time when getting the board started.

We interact with Google Drive by using libraries/gems in both Ruby and Python.

This has not been used in a while but served a purpose at some point.

Please contact me with any tips/techniques you think I would benefit from.
